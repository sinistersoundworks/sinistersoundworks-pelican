# Mixing Preparation Guide

Thank you for choosing me to mix your music! To ensure the best results and a smooth workflow, please follow these guidelines when preparing and exporting your files.

## 1. General Guidelines

**Check for Clipping:** Make sure none of your tracks peak above -3dBFS. Keep headroom to allow for proper mixing.

**Consolidate Audio Tracks:** Each track should start at the same time (bar 1, beat 1), even if there is silence at the beginning.

**Remove Unnecessary Processing:** Unless it is a key part of the sound, disable all EQ, compression, reverb, and effects.

**Label Files Clearly:** Use descriptive names (e.g., "Vox_Lead.wav", "Kick_in.wav", "Bass_DI.wav", "Guitar_Rtm_L", "Guitar_Rtm_R" etc.).

**Provide Tempo & Key Info:** Include the BPM and key signature.

**Reference Mix:** Send a rough mix if available.

**MIDI File with Tempo & Markers:** Export a MIDI file containing the tempo map and any session markers (such as section labels, tempo changes, and time signature changes).

## 2. File Formats

### Audio Stems

**Format:** WAV or AIFF (24-bit or 32-bit float, 44.1kHz or 48kHz). Higher sample rates are accepted but I would normally downsample them to 48kHz before I start mixing.

**Alignment:** All files should start from the same point in the session.

**Separation:** Export each instrument and vocal track individually.

### Edits

Make sure all edits (crossfades etc.) and auto tuning are consolidated in the wav files.

### Vocal Tracks

- Separate lead vocals, harmonies, doubles, and ad-libs.
- Provide dry versions (without reverb, delay, or heavy compression).
- Optionally, include a processed version if you want me to hear your vision.

### Bass

I prefer a DI signal from the bass here, as well as MIDI and Amps or DIRECT signal you might have recorded. Any combinations of these are welcome. I can generate a realistic sounding bass from MIDI only, if that's all you have.

### Guitars

- If possible, include both amplified tracks (wet) and DI tracks (dry) for re-amping options.

### Drums

- Provide individual stems: Kick, Snare (Top/Bottom), Hi-Hat, Toms, Overheads, and Room.
- If using programmed drums, include MIDI files for flexibility.

### Drum Midi Labeling

If you are giving me drums in MIDI format, please make a separate midi track for each articulation (kick, snare, tom, cymbal hit, cymbal choke, hi hat open, hi hat closed) and label it as such. This way, it will not matter what midi note is used and I can re-arrange your drums to best suit my workflow.

### Synths & MIDI

- If you used virtual instruments, include both rendered audio tracks and MIDI files in case adjustments are needed.

### MIDI File with Tempo & Markers (Required)

Export a MIDI file (.mid) containing the tempo map and markers: Create a blank MIDI track in your song and then export a MIDI file including tempo markers from within your DAW.

This is very important as it ensures that I have the correct tempo changes, time signature changes, and any labeled sections.

## 3. Additional Files

**Reference Tracks:** If you have a specific sound in mind, send professionally mixed songs that match your desired style.

**Session Notes:** If there are specific mix requests (e.g., effects, vocal treatment), let me know in a separate text file or email.

## 4. How to Send Your Files

**Organize into a Folder:** Name it "[ArtistName_SongTitle_BPM_AudioBitrate_SampleRate_Version]". (e.g.: "TenaciousD_Tribute_120_24_48_v1")

**Zip the Folder:** Compress it into a .zip file.

**Upload via a Cloud Service:** Use WeTransfer, Google Drive, Dropbox or another service.

**Send a Download Link:** Email or message me with the link. Please make sure the link is accessible (e.g make it public).
